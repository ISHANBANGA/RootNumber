# TutorialThird

A basic C++ program to get the root numbers, whether getting the roots if the determinant is postive, equal or negative. Also to get Real root and Imaginary root.

This program can be used in an interactive website in which user can get the roots by entering just the coeffiecients of the equations.

However this program is just the basics and could be changed by adding more features such as adding graphs.
